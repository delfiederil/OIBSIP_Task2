# 🎯 **OIBSIP – Number Guessing Game**  
### 🕹️ *Java Console Application*

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The **Number Guessing Game** is a Java console-based application developed as part of the  
**Oasis Infobyte Student Internship Program (OIBSIP)**.

This game generates a number between **1 and 100** and challenges the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts. Based on the user's input, the program provides hints such as **“Too High”** and **“Too Low”** and calculates the score accordingly.

The project demonstrates **core Java programming concepts** including control flow, user input handling, and basic game logic.
