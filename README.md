🎯 OIBSIP – Number Guessing Game
(Java Console Application)
📌 Project Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a Java console-based application developed as part of the
Oasis Infobyte Student Internship Program (OIBSIP).

This game generates a number between 1 and 100 and challenges the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts. Based on the user's input, the program provides hints such as “Too High” and “Too Low” and calculates the score accordingly.

The project demonstrates core Java programming concepts including control flow, user input handling, and basic game logic.
